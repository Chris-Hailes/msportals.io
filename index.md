Welcome to this community driven project to list all of Microsoft's portals in one place.

NOTICE: Starting 15 October 2024, Microsoft will require users to use multifactor authentication (MFA) to sign into the Azure portal, Microsoft Entra admin center, and Intune admin center. To ensure your users maintain access, youâ€™ll need to enable MFA by 15 October 2024. For more information visit [https://aka.ms/mfaforazure](https://aka.ms/mfaforazure).
